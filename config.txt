# Sync Channel  (IMPORTANT, README)
#       > By customer request this function has been added to the script. Any boards on this channel will automatically have the same notes in the same positions.  Removed notes will be deleted automatically from all boards.
#       > It is extremely important to test your setup with this as a board at Zero Rotation, and a new note created on the positive Y axis, will ALWAYS be on that side of the board, with the rotation applied.
#       > Sync does NOT however sync admins, so notes on two boards could have different access lists as they would be paired to their parent board.
